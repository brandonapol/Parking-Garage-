Group "Sauce" (Brandon, Alex, Randy)

In this Parking Garage assignment, the workload was equally challenging and rewarding.
Alex and Randy forked code from Brandon's initial repo. They also set Brandon's repo as an upstream, and pushed accordingly.
The project was primarily an exercise in group collaboration, with 100% of the code written on a Zoom call betwen all group members.
Brandon wisely pasted the algorithm of the assignment into the .py document and we simply followed the steps, with plenty of trial and error along the way.

Randy wrote the "get" method(lines 31 through 41), Alex wrote the "pay for parking" method(lines 43 through 64) and Brandon set us up for success with the cleanly formatted Class definition, the rough outline of code, and the "decision tree"(lines 15 through 29).

But a lot of this code was fixed "on-the-fly" through word of mouth group commentary, in the spirit of collaboration. 

Thank you.
